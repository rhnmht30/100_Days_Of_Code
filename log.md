### Day 4: June 30, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Exhausted

**Today's Progress**: No coding today due to health issues and sudden change in routine.  

**Thoughts:** Planning to take single course per day to remove exertions.


### Day 5: July 1, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Learning

**Today's Progress**: Created my FreeCodeCamp account and completed some basic HTML challenges. Hoping to complete it soon.

**Thoughts:** : I think FCC is a nice way to practice and learn web development. I am super excited to get one of those cerificates


### Day 6: July 2, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Challenges 

**Today's Progress**: 4 HRS - 70 challenges to ashes! FCC is the best

**Thoughts:**: HTML and CSS are looking easy to me but I don't know how I am going to retain them for long enough.


### Day 7: July 3, 2018 
#### :mortar_board: Learning 

**Today's Progress**: Completed Week 1 lecture of CS50x and dived onto pset 1. Did some more challeges in Applied Visual design section

### Day 8: July 4, 2018 
#### :mortar_board: Learning 

**Today's Progress**: Watched few java lectures today. Also trying to come onto a solution for my pset named mario.

**Thoughts:** Mario seems easy but after thinking for a while I think it will take some time.


### Day 9: July 5, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Learning 

**Today's Progress**: All challenges completed for first certification at FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** I am hopefully going to start the projects required for my first certificate soon.

**Today's Progress**: Completed my first project at FCC to build a tribute page. I devoted my tribute to Sir Tim Berners-Lee
Here's the link to page. [Tribute Page](https://codepen.io/rhnmht30/full/RJXeJO/)

**Thoughts:** Building my first webpage was a great challenge for me. I had to spend a lot a time to make the page responsive for all devices and I guess that was the first requirement to become a web developer.


### Day 13: July 9, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Building, reviewing & learning

**Today's Progress**: I was enable to retain most of the CSS flexbox and grid lessons learnt from FCC, so I took a short course on it from WesBos.  

**Thoughts:**: FCC cirriculum is great for practice but if you do not apply what you are learning then you ought to forget certain things when you work on a project.


### Day 14: July 10, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Learning and Reviewing

**Today's Progress**: Watched more lectures of CSS grid and now I am comfortable with both flexbox and grid.

### Day 15: July 11, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Solving

**Today's Progress**: After 2 days of CSS I needed a break from it, so started working on pset1 again. Completed mario and both cash + credit problems. Submitted my first commit on github using check50 and submit50.   

**Thoughts:**: CS50x's way of submitting problem sets is so nice. I love github and look forward to learn it in more detail


### Day 16: July 12, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Building

**Today's Progress**: Got back on the survey form project, applied the things I learnt few days back. It is almost done.  

**Thoughts:**: Finally reviewing what I had learnt few days back has paid off. Now I know where I was lacking in getting things done.


### Day 17: July 13, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Learning    

**Today's Progress**: Back to java lectures after a long time. Learnt some OOP concepts like composition, polymorphism and encapsulation.

**Thoughts:**: I ejoyed coding on this project today, as it was satisfying applying the things I have learnt so far.


### Day 20: July 16, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Relaxing

**Today's Progress**: Did nothing today

**Thoughts:**: Relaxing for a day with friends and family is  a nice way to rejuvenate your mind and body.


### Day 21: July 17, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Learning and Thinking

**Today's Progress**: Finally decided to pause the java course and continue with Python, CS50x and FCC as there is too much on my plate right now. Later in the evening worked on pset3 where I have to write some code for a musical program to work. The final compiled version of code will play the bday song that I will create by writing the musical notes in digital format, ofcourse after I learn how to do so. 

**Thoughts:**: Having too much to study at once is creating a lot of pressure in my mind, that is the reason why I paused Java lectures as I am forgetting faster than learning anything.


### Day 22: July 18, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Building
![](https://rhnmht30.github.io/pics/product_landing.png)

**Today's Progress**: Spent the day working on the [product landing page](https://codepen.io/rhnmht30/full/RBRzKR/) project at FCC. I was able to build a responsive site after few tweaks here and there at the end of the day.

**Thoughts:**: My knowledge of HTML and CSS is getting stronger day by day and this is solely because of practice.


### Day 23: July 19, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Learning and solving

**Today's Progress**: Completed a couple of sections in Udemy's Python course I was enrolled to long time ago. Worked and completed the pset3 and it was difficult but satisfying to complete.

**Thoughts:**: Pset3 was designed in a such a way that I could understand how C can be so much powerful today also. I was immensely satisfied by my code when it compiled and played the bday song for me, it felt as if it was actually my bday.


### Day 24: July 20, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Building

**Thoughts:**: I have been thinking too much on the content of these pages and that is delaying the process of completion but when I didn't thought of that, I was able to complete the project without any issues.


### Day 25: July 21, 2018
#### :mortar_board: Building and Celebrating
![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DipsrkWVMAAulkV.jpg:large)

**Today's Progress**: Started working on the last project of FCC's Responsive web design certification and that is personal portfolio webpage. After having some design issues, bad links and unresponsive images, I was finally able to host my site on Github pages. I tried to make it as good as possible like I added a favicon to it so as to make it look different from other webpages. 
Finally after submitting the last project I was able to claim my first certificate from FCC.
Check it out here: [Rohan Mehta](https://rhnmht30.github.io/).

**Thoughts:**: I am a quarter way through of my 100 days of code and this certificate makes me feel more energetic.
